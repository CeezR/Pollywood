  "summary": "Zac was alone in the middle of the forest when the world changed. The whole planet was introduced to the multiverse by an unfeeling System... or God. A universe where an endless number of races and civilizations fought for power and dominion. Zac finds himself stuck in the wilderness surrounded by deadly beasts, demons, and worse. Alone, lost and without answers, he must find the means to survive and get stronger in this new cut-throat reality. With only a hatchet for his weapon, he'll have to seek out his family before the world collapses... or die trying.",

      "description": "A dense forest of green, where trees stood tall and branches wove together overhead, dappling the forest floor with sunlight. Ferns and moss carpeted the ground, and the air was thick with the scent of earth and leaves. Birds chirped softly, their songs mingling with the gentle rustle of foliage. Streams trickled through, their waters clear and lined with lush, green vegetation."
